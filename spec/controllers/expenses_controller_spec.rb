# The create action in the /app/controllers/expenses_controller.rb file does the following to split the expenses equally:
# Subtract the expense per person from every personâ€™s arrears and update the row in the expenses table.
# For the person who paid the expense, add the total amount paid to their arrears and subtract the expense per person if they checked their name.
# If their name is unchecked, add the total amount and update the record.
